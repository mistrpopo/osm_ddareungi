Hello guys,
I live in Seoul, Korea and I noticed that the public bike infrastructure near me was missing from OpenStreetMap.
I managed to download the existing OSM data using https://overpass-turbo.eu/# and I got 131 stations.

In parallel, I got official data from the official Korean website and they report 1540 stations. The data is complete, with name, latitude, longitude, bike capacity and everything. 
I managed to load the whole data into a data-frame with Python and sanity-check it all and it all looks fine.

After comparing the data, it seems even the existing public bike infrastructure from OSM is outdated and incorrect.
Some are wrongly named, some have incorrect info, some have inaccurate location.

I want to mass-edit the OSM data, if possible preview the data before upload.
I might potentially keep the description from some nodes that might be useful.

So, how do I go about doing this without manual input?!

What I still need to do :

- make a diff of all stations
  - identify stations that were not added yet to OSM and add them
  - identify conflicting stations and merge them
    - conflicting names : keep the OSM name in description if informative, keep other languages descriptions
  - identify stations from OSM that do not appear on the official data (hopefully none)

- upload to OSM

- contact seoul bike because map doesn't work on firefox
