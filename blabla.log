Hello,
I noticed that the public bike infrastructure is outdated and incorrect.
Some are wrongly named, some have incorrect info.

I got official data from ***
They report 1540 stations.
I want to mass-edit the OSM data, if possible preview the data before upload.
Potentially keep the description from some nodes that might be useful.

I managed to download the OSM data using https://overpass-turbo.eu/#
I got 131 stations.

What I still need to do :

- make a diff of all stations
  - identify stations that were not added yet to OSM and add them
  - identify conflicting stations and merge them
    - conflicting names : keep the OSM name in description if informative, keep other languages descriptions
  - identify stations from OSM that do not appear on the official data (hopefully none)
